Hi! My name is Yahya, and I work as a **DevOps consultant** for a canadian startup. <img src="3DTOUCH.gif" align="right" width="300" >

My experience includes **process automation**, **cloud infrastructure development**, **security operations**, and support for existing procedures.

I'm highly dynamic and able to quickly adapt to changing situations. With a strong background in problem solving and creative thinking, I have the ability to think outside of the box while still maintaining an organized approach.

My enthusiasm for learning new skills makes me a valuable asset in any team environment as well as my commitment to delivering results on time.
